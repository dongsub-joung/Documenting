## launchd
* User: root
* Process group: launchd

This particular process, launchd, is the service management framework used by macOS, similar in some ways to Service Control Manager on Windows or systemd on many Linux distributions. A “service” is anything running in the background; on macOS these are commonly referred to as daemons and generally have names ending with the letter “d.” Most everything your Mac does—connecting to networks, showing things on the display, and backing up your files—is done by a daemon on some level.

## mDNSresponder
* User: (underbar)mdnsresponder 
* Process group: mDNSResponder

Today’s process, mDNSResponder, is a core part of the  [Bonjour protocol](https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/) . Bonjour is Apple’s zero-configuration networking service, which basically means it’s how Apple devices find each other on a network. Our process, mDNSResponder, regularly scans your local network looking for other Bonjour-enabled devices.

> Bonjour is the reason this works: the protocol allows two computers on the same network to easily find each other, meaning the list of shared iTunes libraries is always up-to-date.  

[What Is mDNSResponder, And Why Is It Running On My Mac?](https://www.howtogeek.com/338914/what-is-mdnsresponder-and-why-is-it-running-on-my-mac/)

### How to Check if Bonjour is Running on your Mac  

1. Open Safari and snap the little book symbol on the upper right of the window  
2. On the COLLECTIONS menu, click Bonjour. On the Bonjour wayfarer, all gadgets that are bonjour-empowered will show  

### Switching off and On mDNSresponder to Disable Bonjour

## WindowServer  

* parent: launchd  
* User: (undervar)windowServer  
* Prosess group: WindowServer  

[What Is the Process WindowServer, and Why Is It Running on My Mac?](https://www.howtogeek.com/312755/what-is-the-process-windowserver-and-why-is-it-running-on-my-mac/)  

WindowServer is a core part of macOS, and a liaison of sorts between your applications and your display.  

[window server lifecycle](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2083/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003794-CH1-SUBSECTION14)  

### Why Is WindowServer Using So Much CPU  
As we’ve said, every application communicates with WindowServer in order to draw things on your display. If WindowServer is taking up a lot of CPU power, try closing applications and seeing if the usage drops. If you see a particularly large drop after closing a specific program, that program is probably responsible for the high CPU usage.
